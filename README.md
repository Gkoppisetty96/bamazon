### BAMAZON

This application uses a command-line based storefront and a MySQL databse backend. This application presents two interfaces: customer and manager. 



## Customer

This allows the user to view the current store inventory: item IDs, descriptions, department, and price.

The user can then purchase items using the item ID and entering the desired quantity.

If that quantity is in stock, the order goes through; this displays the purchase price and updates the store database.

If the store is out of stock, the user must modify their order.
